      There aren't many great options for supporting comments on a blog powered by a static site generator. What does exist is either too complicated to set up, or involves selling your soul to a third-party provider that <a href="https://www.macarthur.me/posts/keep-using-disqus-if-you-dont-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="underline">bastardizes your privacy, kills your site's performance, and compromises your SEO</a> (ðŸ‘‹, Disqus!). The tradeoffs are just too high.
