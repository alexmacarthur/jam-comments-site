title: Contributor Authentication
---

No contributor is required to create an account to post a comment. It's similar to dropping on a WordPress site -- give a name and an optional email address, and you're set. When someone replies to a comment from such an author, that author will be notified via email that someone has replied.

However, there are advantages to creating a dedicated account before commenting:

**You'll have quick access to comments you leave across any site.**

That's nice from a historical perspective. If you'd like to find a comment you dropped on a blog six months ago, log into your account and dig it up.

**You'll be able to delete your comments.**

You can't do this if you leave a comment anonymously.

**You'll (soon) be given a visual indicator of your realness.**

It's not shipped now, but eventually, some sort of UI treat will be left next to comments that were left by authenticated individuals, rather than potentially some internet troll.
