### What if I want to export all of my data?

That functionality has yet to be built into the application, but I can get it for you if you [contact me](https://macarthur.me/contact).

### Can I migrate data from Disqus?

Sorry, not yet. But it is on my radar.
### Can I styling everything differently?

Yes! You're encouraged to override styles as needed. A decent, base-level of styles was built into each integration, but to make it fit the look & feel of your site, you can override the `jc-*` classes to your liking.
