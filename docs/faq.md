### Who built this?

Alex MacArthur did. To learn more about me, you can visit [this website](https://macarthur.me/), follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/amacarthur), and if you want, [send me a message](https://macarthur.me/contact). I'll do my best to respond promptly!

### What if I subscribe and end up hating this tool with a burning passion?

[Contact me](https://macarthur.me/contact) and I'll refund you.

### What if I want to export all of my data?

That functionality has yet to be built into the application, but I can get it for you if you [contact me](https://macarthur.me/contact).

### Can I migrate data from Disqus?

Not yet.
### Can I style everything differently?

Yes! You're encouraged to override styles as needed. A decent, base-level of styles was built into each integration, but to make it fit the look & feel of your site, you can override the `jc-*` classes to your liking. Get friendly with your browser's dev tools and have at it.
