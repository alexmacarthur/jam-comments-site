In order to get up & running with JamComments, you'll need to do the following:

## Create an Account

Do so by using the button in the navigation above, or navigate to the [JamComments application](http://go.jamcomments.com/). Signing up for an account is **free**, but you'll be limited one site and be able to collect a maximum of 10 comments. If you'd like to collect comments beyond that, sign up for a paid account.

Subscriptions are managed by [Stripe](https://stripe.com). No sensitive payment information is stored within the application.

## Create a Site

After logging in, head to the ["Sites" page](https://go.jamcomments.com/sites) and create a new one. Free plans can create one site, but if you need more, consider upgrading to premium plan. When setting up a site, you'll be asked to name it, as well as provide a domain. Keep in mind that this is the only domain from which comments will be accepted. So, if you'd like to submit "test" comments on a development branch that uses a temporary domain (like one generated by Vercel or Netlify), you'll need to have [development mode](https://jamcomments.com/docs/development) enabled in those environments.

## Add a Webhook (Optional)

If you'd like to trigger a new build for your site after a new comment has been collected, you can do so on your site's settings page, found at `Sites > Your Site Name > Webhooks`. Most of the popular Jamstack hosts provide this feature out-of-the-box, including [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/more/deploy-hooks) and [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-hooks/).

## Enable Auto-Approval (Optional)

By default, new comments will not be automatically approved and published (although you will get an email notification). If you'd like to do so, you can toggle on auto-approval by navigating to your site's settings page at `Sites > Your Site Name`.

## Generate an API Key

Your site will need this in order for comments to be accepted. To generate a key, navigate to your [Account Settings](https://go.jamcomments.com/settings) and scroll down to the "API Token" section. There, you'll be able to generate a fresh key or replace an existing one. Make sure you keep this value safe. Once created, it won't be shown again.
