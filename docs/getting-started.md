Before installing JamComments on your site, you'll need to do the following:

### 1. Create an Account

To do so, use the button in the navigation above, or navigate to the [JamComments dashboard](http://app.jamcomments.com/).

### 2. Create a Site

After logging into the [dashboard](https://app.jamcomments.com), head to the ["Sites" page](https://app.jamcomments.com/sites) and create a new one. Free plans can create one site, but if you need more, consider upgrading to premium plan.

### 3. Generate an API Key

Your site will need this in order to create new comments after they're submitted. To generate one, navigate to your [Account Settings](https://app.jamcomments.com/settings/account) and scroll down to the "API Key" section.
